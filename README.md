# Purpose

* As a random password generator site, the goal is to set a random password that is highly secure using an array of symbols, numbers, upper and lower case letters. 
* The goal was to refactor the site to prompt the user to select their variables from length to character types to generate secure passwords at random from 8 to 128 characters; nothing more and nothing less.
